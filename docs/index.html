        <h2>What is a Contract-Driven UI?</h2>
        <p>A Contract-Driven UI is an architectural pattern which allows the UI to focus on the <strong>building
                parameterized components</strong>, enabling your application to be <strong>constructed in JSON</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>The UI implements <strong>components and event handlers</strong> based on the theme of your application. A
            <strong>contract, or
                configuration object</strong> in the form of JSON, is supplied to specify how your application should be
            constructed
            and the parameters associated to those components and event handlers to be built correctly for your user.

        <h2>Why Clerical?</h2>
        <p>Clerical is a very simple and basic implementation of a Contract-Driven UI. Clerical abstracts the concept of
            HTML into JSON, attaching a way to nest configurable components and events with attached state.</p>
        <p>Clerical implments routing, state management, and event management to enable you and your team to create the
            correct web components to allow you to build faster.</p>

        <h2>Flexibility by Simplicity</h2>
        <p>Clerical is flexible to support multiple coding styles and patterns. The framework attaches new DOM events to
            enable easy MV* patterns to be implemented, along with your Web Components to have the flexibility of
            containing a plethora of parameters.</p>
        <p>Clerical was built with as minimal code as possible, utilizing today's ECMAScript standards. That means -
            when you are building your components and events, you are building them on a layer slightly above raw
            JavaScript.</p>
